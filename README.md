## Hi, welcome to my GitHub profile

I'm OtÃ¡vio Murilo, here are some of my amusement.

I'm a backend Senior Software Engineer. My main language is Java, but not only Java. I use Python for scripting and serveless, Kotlin in some backend projects, Javascript in the frontend, and Golang as a hobby.

> My passion is technology, delivering high-quality software following the best practices. I'm a team player that likes to teach and learn everywhere.
